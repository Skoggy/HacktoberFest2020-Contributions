This folder contains programs written in SQL & NoSQL

`hmmmm.... programs in SQL and NoSQL?`

## Why SQL / NoSQL?
Many would say whats programs can we write in SQL and NoSQL.

It's basically not about writing programs but more ficus on concepts of SQL & NoSQL.

Despite NoSQL's rising popularity, it's not a replacement for SQL. It's an alternative. Some projects are better suited to using an SQL database, while others work well with NoSQL.

`If your data is very structured and ACID compliance is a must, SQL is a great choice. On the other hand, if your data requirements aren't clear or if your data is unstructured, NoSQL may be your best bet. The data you store in a NoSQL database does not need a predefined schema like you do for a SQL database.`
